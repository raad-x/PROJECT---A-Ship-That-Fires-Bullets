## Alien Invasion: Making a Game with Python

In the Alien Invasion project, you’ll use the Pygame package to develop a 2D game. The goal of the game is to shoot down a fleet of aliens as they drop down the screen, in levels that increase in speed and difficulty.

### What You'll Learn:

- How to use the Pygame library for game development.
- Techniques for handling user input and game events.
- Managing game assets like images and sounds.
- Implementing collision detection and game mechanics.

By the end of the project, you’ll have gained the skills to create your own 2D games using Pygame.
